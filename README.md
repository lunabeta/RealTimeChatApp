# ⚛️ Vite React Counter App with Docker 🐳

This project is a simple yet effective counter application built with React and Vite, containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment. It demonstrates a basic frontend setup with hot reloading and dependency management, showcasing a modern development workflow. The application increments a counter on button clicks, providing a hands-on example of React state management.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **React Components:** Utilizes React components and JSX syntax for building the user interface.
- **Vite Build Tool:** Configured with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Hot Reloading:** Implements hot reloading for a smooth development experience.
- **Dockerized:** Containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment across different environments.
- **Real-time Communication:** Includes `socket.io-client` for potential real-time features (though not explicitly used in the counter logic).
- **ESLint Integration:** Uses ESLint for code linting and maintaining code quality.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3.  Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Return to the project root directory.

### Running Locally

1.  Start the application using Docker Compose:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command builds and starts the database, backend, and frontend services.

2.  Access the frontend application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💻 Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the counter by clicking the button. The counter value will increment with each click. The frontend is set up for hot reloading, so any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the browser automatically.
